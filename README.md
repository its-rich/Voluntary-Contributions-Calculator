# What is this?
This web application provides a calculator that explains the impact of voluntary contributions on one's super. It was designed to be integrated into Aware Super's existing phone application, thus the UI has been tailored to that theme.

**DISCLAIMER:** This website simplifies a lot of financial information so **PLEASE DO NOT** purely make your financial decisions based off of this calculator. Additionally this is a university project that **IS NOT OFFICIALLY AFFILIATED** with Aware Super.

## Features
* Can see the impact of voluntary contributions over any amount of years
* Can alter your voluntary contributions each year

## Stack
This was developed using ReactJS and is hosted on a Firebase server.

## Other Info
I had originally completed this project using Class Components across 3 separate days, as it had major developments over 3 iterations. Hence the code was plagued by various code smells.

So in order to properly learn React Functional Components & React Hooks, I decided to recreate the project after completing using those methods. I also have integrated a basic CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions.

The refactored code is currently released on the hosted website above: https://econ3117.web.app/.

## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Thus it has all of the usual scripts:
* `npm start`
* `npm test`
* `npm run build`
* `npm run eject`
